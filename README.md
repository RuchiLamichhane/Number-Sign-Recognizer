# Number-Sign-Recognizer
- Here we are using Keras to build a model and Opencv to collect a train data.

### Step 1 :
- Data Collection
  - We have used OpenCV to open Webcam and collect a train and test dataset.

### Step 2:
 - Model Building
   - Here in this step we build a CNN model using keras to train our collected data.
  
### Step 3:
 - Predicting
   - Here in this step we test the model if it is working well or not.
